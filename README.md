# Design patterns implemented in C#

This console project is a documentation about some design patterns implemented in C# by me, in a simple way just for learning and refresh my memory when i need it.

I got this resources from some videos in Youtube and [Refactoring Guru's page](https://refactoring.guru/) (Useful page if you want to learn about Refactoring and Software architecture).

## Software architecture

> Software architecture refers to the fundamental structures of a software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems. Each structure comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both elements and relations. The architecture of a software system is a metaphor, analogous to the architecture of a building. It functions as a blueprint for the system and the developing project, laying out the tasks necessary to be executed by the design teams.

## Design Patterns

> In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

## Unified Modeling Language (UML)

> Unified Modeling Language (UML) makes it possible to describe systems with words and pictures. It can be used to model a variety of systems: software systems, business systems, or any other system. Especially notable are the various graphical charts—use case diagrams with their stick figures or the widely used class diagrams. While these diagrams aren’t fundamentally new, the worldwide unification of modeling languages is new with UML, which was standardized by the Object Management Group (OMG), an international association that promotes open standards for object-oriented applications.
